## What is MoKazino?

MoKazino is something that I always wanted to build, a place to hang out for people of all kinds united by an the fact that they fight for financial freedom and privacy.

And to be clear - this is a casino, you can deposit XMR, wager them (or invest, since the site is community funded), withdraw and relax with other people in the chatroom.

Without going to deep into *what I see this site as*, let's just go to the TODO section.
