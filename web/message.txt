   Hi!

Mokazino has just started!
   Well, not yet. We are waiting for some things to settle. We need a logo, 
investors, friends, happiness.. and nodes to finish sync.
   I am really grateful for the community-funded CCS that made it possible,
for me to deploy this site. I'll continue to provide updates, support and
help to everybody who needs it, if the community wants any changes to be made
to the site, you can be sure that they will land here, within a reasonable time.
   I am inviting everybody to come and play. We have no kyc, instant withdrawals
and deposits, nice support (I'm the support so it got to be nice), on-site chat
linked to the telegram group. And provably fair bets!
   I am hoping to see MoKazino as something that the community has built
together, and something that will keep us together. That's why bankroll
is community-funded, and why an api for the site is* available.
   If you have already made your bet and seen how the site looks like, come to 
the telegram @MoKazinoChat or tweet at me (@MoKazino), tell me what you like and
what you dislike and I will do my best to fix the latter things.

 Good luck. Have fun!
           ~ MoKazino Guy


* It is available I'm finishing writing docs!
